Description: ## What is *django_urls*?
        
        It is flask style urls for django. 
        
        ## How to use it?
        
        ````python
        # app/urls.py or where-ever you want really.
        from django_urls import UrlManager
        app_urls = UrlManager(views_root='dotted.path.to.app.views.module')
        ````
        
        ````python
        # app/views/foo.py
        
        from app.urls import app_urls
        
        @app_urls.path('path/', name='MyView')
        class MyView(View):
            ...
            
        @app_urls.re_path('path2/', name='my_view')
        def my_view(request):
            ...    
        ````
        
        ````python
        # project/urls.py
        from django.urls import include, path
        from app.urls import app_urls
        
        url_patterns = [
            path('some_path/', include(app_urls.url_patterns))
        ]
        ````
        
        
        That's it, not too much setup, right?
